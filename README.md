**About this project

Project Description:**

The aim of the restaurant menu and order analysis project was to extract actionable insights from menu and order data using SQL. The project addressed key business needs, including optimizing menu offerings, improving inventory management, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

To achieve these objectives, the analysis focused on the following key areas:

**1. Menu Analysis:** The project sought to understand the composition of the menu by determining the number of items, identifying the least and most expensive items, counting Italian dishes, and finding the least and most expensive Italian dishes.

**2. Category Analysis: **Analyzing the distribution of dishes across categories was crucial for understanding menu diversity. The project aimed to determine the number of dishes in each category and calculate the average dish price within each category.

**3. Order Analysis:** Understanding customer ordering behavior was essential for improving service efficiency and customer satisfaction. The analysis focused on determining the date range of orders, counting orders and items within this range, identifying orders with the most items, and determining the number of orders with more than 12 items.

**4. Combining Tables:** Combining menu_items and order_details tables allowed for a comprehensive analysis of menu item popularity and customer preferences. The project aimed to identify the least and most ordered items, their respective categories, and the top 5 orders with the highest total spending.

**5. Top Spending Orders:** Exploring the details of high-spending orders provided valuable insights into customer preferences and purchasing behavior. The project focused on understanding the details of the highest spending order and optionally, the top 5 highest spending orders.

**Meaningful insights were derived through a combination of data exploration, SQL query techniques, and result interpretation. The results were presented through clear and insightful reports, enabling restaurant management to make informed decisions regarding menu offerings, inventory management, and customer service strategies.

The project's recommendations, based on the insights uncovered, included optimizing menu pricing, adjusting inventory levels based on category popularity, and tailoring marketing efforts to promote high-demand items.**

**Overall, this project showcases the importance of leveraging data-driven insights to drive success and profitability in the restaurant industry, contributing to enhanced customer satisfaction and business growth.
